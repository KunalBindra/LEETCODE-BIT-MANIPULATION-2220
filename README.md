# LEETCODE-BIT-MANIPULATION-2220
Let's do a dry run of the given `minBitFlips` function with an example. The function calculates the minimum number of bit flips needed to convert `start` to `goal`.

### Example:
Suppose `start = 10` and `goal = 7`.

1. **Binary representation**:
   - `start = 10` in binary is `1010`.
   - `goal = 7` in binary is `0111`.

2. **XOR operation**:
   - `start ^ goal` will give a number where each bit is `1` if the corresponding bits of `start` and `goal` are different, and `0` if they are the same.
   - `1010 ^ 0111 = 1101`.

3. **Counting `1`s**:
   - The number `1101` in binary has three `1`s.
   - So, three bits differ between `start` and `goal`.

4. **Return the result**:
   - The function returns `3`, which is the minimum number of bit flips needed.

### Steps:
- Perform `start ^ goal` to identify where the bits differ.
- Use `Integer.bitCount()` to count the number of `1`s in the result, which gives the number of bit flips.

This function runs in constant time \(O(1)\) because both `start` and `goal` are integers and XOR as well as counting bits are efficient operations.
